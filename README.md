# Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation.

## Introduction:
This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science & Business Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. Throughout this internship, I worked on three key projects that involved comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling. These projects include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Supermarket) ðŸ›’.
- Stock Market Predictions Using Numerical and Textual Analysis ðŸ“ˆ.
- Timeline Analysis: Covid-19 ðŸ¦ .
Each project provided valuable insights and practical experience in applying data science techniques to real-world scenarios.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Supermarket) ðŸ›’
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on retail data from a supermarket. The primary objectives were to identify patterns and trends, understand customer behavior, and gain insights into sales performance. Key analyses included product category performance, sales seasonality, customer demographics, and purchase patterns, providing actionable insights to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.

## 2. Stock Market Predictions Using Numerical and Textual Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
This project involved predicting stock market trends by combining numerical data and textual analysis. I utilized historical stock prices and integrated sentiment analysis of news articles and financial reports. Machine learning models were trained to predict stock price movements, leveraging both quantitative data and qualitative insights to enhance prediction accuracy and support informed investment decisions.

## 3. Timeline Analysis: Covid-19  ðŸ¦ 
In the Timeline Analysis: Covid-19 project, I analyzed the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic over time. This involved tracking key metrics such as infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates globally and regionally. The project aimed to visualize trends, identify significant events and interventions, and provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact, assisting in understanding and managing public health responses.
